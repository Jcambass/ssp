## Deploy

We build this localy and push to the docker registry. This safes space on the dokku host but means a less portable dev environment. We might change this in the future.

1. In Pico-8 : `export ssp.html`
2. In term: `mv ssp.html index.html`

> ![NOTE]
> Make sure to have `docker login ghcr.io` before

`docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t ghcr.io/jcambass/ssp-p8:BUILD_NUMBER .`
`docker push ghcr.io/jcambass/ssp-p8:BUILD_NUMBER`


ON DOKKU

```
dokku git:from-image ssp-p8 ghcr.io/jcambass/ssp-p8:BUILD_NUMBER
```
